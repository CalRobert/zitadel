title: Limits
---

New self-hosting and [ZITADEL Cloud instances](https://zitadel.com/signin) by default allow **public organization registrations**.
An IAM_OWNER can allow and disallow the endpoint */ui/login/register/org* or resetting the property
to the default configuration.

If you would like to disable or limit features,
you can do so using the [limiting Admin APIs](/category/apis/resources/admin/limits).

[Read about more limiting audit trails if you are self-hosting](/self-hosting/manage/usage_control#limit-audit-trails).
