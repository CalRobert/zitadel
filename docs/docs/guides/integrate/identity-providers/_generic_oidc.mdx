Go back to the Generic OIDC Provider template you opened before in ZITADEL](#open-the-google-identity-provider-template).
Add the [client ID and secret created before on your Google App](#client-id-and-client-secret).



You can optionally configure the following settings.
A useful default will be filled if you don't change anything.

**Scopes**: The scopes define which scopes will be sent to the provider, `openid`, `profile`, and `email` are prefilled.
This information will be taken to create/update the user within ZITADEL.
ZITADEL ensures that at least the `openid`-scope is always sent.





The Generic OIDC Provider allows you to configure any OIDC compliant identity provider.

The following information you need to fill out by yourself:

<li><b>Name</b> {props.name}</li>
<li><b>Issuer</b> {props.issuer}</li>
<li><b>Client-ID</b> {props.clientid}</li>
<li><b>Scopes</b>: (openid, profile, email is preconfigured)</li>
