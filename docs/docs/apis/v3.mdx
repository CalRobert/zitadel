title: APIs V3 (Preview)
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

APIs (V3) organize access by resources (users, settings, etc.), unlike context-specific V1 APIs.
This simplifies finding the right API, especially for multi-organization resources.
V3 also offers more flexibility over the V2 API in these points:
- User schema definition for custom user management.
- Behavior customization (API call manipulation, webhooks).

**Note**: V3 is currently in [Preview](/support/software-release-cycles-support#preview) and not yet generally available (breaking changes possible). Check individual services for availability.

[^1]: Standalone Resources
    - Resources are specific to a context level (system, instance, org, ...).

[^2]: Multitenancy Enabled Resources
    - Resources can be assigned to different context levels (system, instance, org, ...)
    - Lower-level contexts can reuse the resources from higher-level contexts but not modify them.
    - Lower-level contexts can self-disable and enable resources from higher-level contexts. This affects their context and their sub-level contexts. For example, if a system level context is disabled on the instance level, it is also disabled on the org level.
    - Disabled resources are only returned for queries within the context-level where they have been disabled or higher-level contexts but not for lower-level contexts.

[^3]: Multitenancy Enabled Settings
    - Instance level settings if no context is given
    - System level settings if system context is given
    - Org level settings if orgid context is give
    - All settings properties can be partially updated
    - All settings properties can be partially reset, so their value defaults to the higher-level contexts property value. For a boolean value, the property must support *true*, *false*, *inherit* and *undefined (no change)* in proto that would be an optional oneof *true*, *false*, *inherit*
    - All settings properties returned by queries contain the value as well as the context where the value is inherited from.
