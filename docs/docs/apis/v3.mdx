title: APIs V3 (Preview)
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

APIs (V3) organize access by resources (users, settings, etc.), unlike context-specific V1 APIs.
This simplifies finding the right API, especially for multi-organization resources.
V3 also offers more flexibility over the V2 API in these points:
- User schema definition for custom user management.
- Behavior customization (API call manipulation, webhooks).

**Note**: V3 is currently in [Preview](/support/software-release-cycles-support#preview) and not yet generally available (breaking changes possible). Check individual services for availability.

- Resources:
    - Instances (including domains)
    - Organizations (including domains)
    - LoginPolicy [^1] (including token lifetimes, lockout, password complexity etc.)
    - NotificationPolicy [^1]
    - MessageTexts [^1]
    - Metadata [^1] (including API foreign keys like privacy policy, login texts, external IDP allowed etc.)
    - Restrictions [^1]
    - Features [^1]
    - Actions [^2]
    - User Schemas [^2]
    - Auth Factors [^2]
    - IDPs [^2]
    - Grants [^2] (added target types project and user)
    - Memberships [^2]
    - Apps [^2]
    - SMTP Providers [^2] (only target types system and instance)
    - SMS Providers [^2]
    - Limits
    - Projects
    - Sessions
    - Users

[^1]: Hierarchical Resource
    - Instance level resource if no context is given
    - System level resource if system context is given
    - Org level resource if org context is given
    - Effective resource returned on GET requests with all resolved values from the hierarchy (defaults) for the given context

[^2]: Linked Resources
   - Resources that are linked to other resources (e.g. user schema linked to an organization)
   - Linked resources have a context level as target type (e.g. org, instance, system)
   - Linked resources can be self-disabled and enabled in sub-contexts by patching the enabled property
   - GET requests on a linked resource return the enabled / disabled status of the resource in the given context
